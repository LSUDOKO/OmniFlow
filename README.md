## üß≠ Onboarding Flow (Product + Tech)

The onboarding experience adapts dynamically to the user's region, locale, and KYC requirements. Steps are sourced from `src/services/paymentService.ts` and localized via `src/services/localizationService.ts`. The flow is orchestrated by `src/components/onboarding/OnboardingFlow.tsx`.

### Flow Overview

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Open Onboarding Modal] --> B{Detect Region}
    B -->|<3.5s| C[Region = Detected]
    B -->|Timeout/Fail| D[Fallback Region = US]
    C --> E[Detect Browser Locale]
    D --> E
    E --> F[Set Locale + Build Steps]
    F --> G[Welcome]
    G --> H[Region Selection]
    H --> I[Wallet Setup]
    I --> J{KYC Requirements}
    J -->|email| K[Email Verification]
    J -->|phone| L[Phone Verification]
    J -->|ID/Docs| M[Identity Verification]
    K --> N[Payment Setup]
    L --> N
    M --> N
    I --> N
    N --> O[Completion]
    O --> P[Close + Persist Onboarding Data]
```

### State and Progression
- __Region detection timeout__: 3.5s with safe default to `US` and in-modal loader.
- __Auto-advance__: `Welcome` and `Completion` steps auto-advance after a short delay.
- __Proceed gating__: The Continue button enables only after a step calls `onComplete()`.
- __Resilience__: Initialization errors display a helpful message and proceed with defaults.
- __Data__: Completed step IDs deduplicated in `onboardingData.completedSteps`.

## üß© Problems Solved (Engineering Notes)

These notes capture real issues encountered and how we solved them for future maintainability.

### 1) Onboarding occasionally hung at start
- __Symptoms__: Modal showed nothing or remained stuck before first step.
- __Root cause__: Region detection could stall or fail, and the UI returned `null` during init.
- __Fix__: In `OnboardingFlow.tsx`
    - Added a 3.5s timeout wrapper around `paymentService.detectUserRegion()` with a default fallback to `US`.
    - Rendered an in-modal `Spinner` + helpful message instead of returning `null` until steps are ready.
    - Set safe defaults and error message on initialization failure.
    - Reset state on modal close to avoid stale state when reopening.
    - Added targeted debug logs to trace step progress.
    - Deduplicated `completedSteps` to avoid repeated entries.
- __Outcome__: No silent hangs; onboarding reliably progresses with clear UX feedback.

### 2) Proceed button didn‚Äôt enable on some steps
- __Cause__: Step didn‚Äôt signal completion or completion array had duplicates masking state.
- __Fix__: Ensured every step calls `onComplete()` with expected data. Deduplicated `completedSteps` and set `canProceed` on completion.
- __Outcome__: Consistent gating and smooth navigation.

### 3) Region change didn‚Äôt always allow moving forward
- __Cause__: After region update, `canProceed` wasn‚Äôt set when on `region_selection`.
- __Fix__: Explicitly set `canProceed(true)` on region change if current step is `region_selection`.
- __Outcome__: Users can continue immediately after choosing a region.
