## 🎬 Demo Flow (3-minute pitch)

### Minute 1: Problem & Solution
> "RWA market is $300T but fragmented across chains. SolanaFlow is the first universal router connecting physical assets with digital identity across Solana and EVM."

### Minute 2: Live Demo
1. **Social Login** → "No seed phrases, just Google login"
2. **Tokenize Asset** → "Turn real estate into NFT on Solana"
3. **Cross-Chain Bridge** → "Move to Ethereum via Wormhole"
4. **Identity Verification** → "DID credentials prove ownership"
5. **Dashboard View** → "Unified portfolio across all chains"

### Minute 3: Market Impact
> "Ready for production with enterprise compliance. Targeting $10B RWA market with first mover advantage in cross-chain identity."
